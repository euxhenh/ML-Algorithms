bakrie has reportedly said indonesia  which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer  owes the paris club about 5 bn 5 bn mr bakrie told the bisnis indonesia newspaper that a 5 bn donors  aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary this aid comes on top of a previously-pledged 5 bn package most of this normal aid  would be used to finance the country s budget deficit the indonesian economics minister explained that the money 5 bn in grants and 5 m in soft loans was for the rebuilding of aceh province  which was badly hit by the tsunami of 5 december nevertheless  one of mr bakrie s deputies  mahendra siregar  told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments  what is true is that we are still discussing the paris club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium that s how far we are at this stage   said mr siregar  the 5 member countries of the paris club are owed about 5 bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the indian ocean tsunami indonesia  sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer  which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little thailand and india have however declined the offer  with thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while india said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid putting off payments may low a country s rating among financial organisations  making it more expensive and more difficult

5 in 5  its best performance since 5  figures from the trade ministry show  the advance  the second fastest in asia after china  was led by growth of 5 in the key manufacturing sector however  a slower than-expected fourth quarter points to more modest growth for the trade driven economy in 5 as global technology demand fall back slowdowns in the us and china could hit electronics exports  while the tsunami disaster may effect the service sector  economic growth is set to halve in singapore this year to between 5 and 5 in the fourth quarter  the city state s gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 5 that was up from the third quarter  when it fell 5  but was well below analyst forecasts  i am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number the main drag came from electronics

followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly sars virus in 5 bank set to leave rates on hold uk interest rates are set to remain on hold at 5 following the latest meeting of the bank of england  the bank s rate setting committee has put up rates five times in the past year but rates have been on hold since september amid signs of a slowdown economic growth slowed in the previous quarter  as manufacturing output fell  while consumer confidence has slipped there is also growing evidence that the previously booming uk

economy had hit a  softer patch  after rapid economic growth in the first half of 5 richard jeffrey  chief economist at bridgewell securities  said it was very unlikely that the bank of england would put rates up again this time around  there have been sufficient signs in the economy of a slowdown to stay the bank of england s hand   he told bbc radio 5 s today programme however  mr jeffrey said he believed the slowdown in economic activity was temporary and it was dangerous to assume that rates had peaked  i still think interest rates are going up   he said  we are not out of the woods us trade gap hits record in 5 the gap between us exports and imports hit an all-time high of 5 bn in 5  latest figures show  the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 5 above the previous record 5 s imbalance of 5 bn the deficit with china  up 5 at 5 bn  was the largest ever recorded with a single country however  on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by 5 in december to 5 bn the us consumer s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars  and even wine and cheese  reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush s economic policies  democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices for example  they believe china s currency policy which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 5 has given china s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors  meanwhile  the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world  spurring on more demand for imported goods some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets  which may in turn harm growth for all of 5  us exports rose 5 to 5 trillion  but imports rose even faster by 5 to a new record of 5 trillion foreign oil exports surged by 5 to a record 5 bn  reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand imports were not affected by the dollar s weakness last year  we expect the deficit to continue to widen in 5 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend said economist marie-pierre ripert at ixis chinese exports rise 5 in 5 exports from china leapt during 5 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth the spurt put china s trade surplus a sore point with some of its trading partners at a six year high it may also increase pressure on china to relax the peg joining its currency  the yuan  with the weakening dollar the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as china s tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 5 in 5 for the second year in a row state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 5 rise in tax revenues to 5 trillion yuan according to the ministry of commerce  china s exports totalled 5 bn in december  taking the annual total up 5 to 5 bn with imports rise a similar amount  the deficit rose to 5 bn the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 5 bn yuan in 5  according to mr xie china s exporting success has made the trade deficit of the united states soar even further and made trade with china a sensitive political issue in washington the peg keeping the yuan around 5 to the dollar is often blamed by us lawmakers for job losses at home a us report issued on tuesday on behalf of a congressionally mandated panel said almost 5 million posts disappeared between 5 and 5 the pace accelerated in the final three years of the period  said the report for the us china economic and security review commission  moving out of labour intensive industries and into more hi tech sectors the us s overall trade deficit with china was 5 bn in 5 and is expected to rise to about 5 bn for 5 yukos owner sues russia for 5 bn the majority owner of embattled russian oil firm yukos has sued the russian government for 5 bn the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos  main production arm  yugansk  to state run oil group rosneft for 5 bn to offset a massive back tax bill group menatep  the gibraltar based holding company which controls 5 of yukos  says this was illegal menatep has already asked rosneft to repay a 5 m loan that yugansk had secured on its assets  the russian government s argument for selling yuganskneftegaz the unit s full name was that yukos owed more than 5 bn in back taxes for the years from 5 onwards it accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities  and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze yukos accounts and seize yugansk  but critics say the sell-off  and the assault on yukos  finances  are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control according to menatep  the government s actions were contrary to the 1994 energy charter treaty  which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments  we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos  its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation   said tim osborne  a director of group menatep  the time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today  menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from 5 bn to  virtually nothing  since 5 as a result of the russian government s action  as its shares have fallen 5 according to its paris lawyer  emmanuel gaillard of shearman and sterling  the overall claim is based on that figure  with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in stockholm or the hague  mr gaillard said while russia has signed the charter  it has never ratified it which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case but mr gaillard told bbc news that the charter came into effect on signature  not ratification  russia has said in the past that it is bound by it  so as to attract foreign investors   he said  yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a us court for bankruptcy protection it took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of yugansk first to a little known shell company  which in turn was bought by rosneft yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky  currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own  was one of the founders of menatep. he has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors arsenal  may seek full share listing  arsenal vice chairman david dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the london stock exchange  speaking at the soccerex football business forum in dubai  he said a full listing was  one of the options  for funding after the club moves to its new stadium the club which is currently listed on the smaller ofex share exchange is due to move into its new 5 seater emirates stadium at ashburton grove for the start of the 5 season mr dein also warned the current level of tv coverage of the premiership may be reaching saturation level  with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season  when arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 5 this season to 5 in two years  time the club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 5 to 5 of turnover  and has not ruled out other money earning means  including a full share listing  when the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review   mr dein said   listing would be one option  but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet we want to be in the best financial health maybe clubs can do it  manchester united have been a success mr dein said that  although television money and coverage had driven the english game forward in the past 5 years he feared there might now be too many games being shown since the formation of the premier league in season 5  premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar television has been the driving force over the past 5 years but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world s leading league competition  we must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline  and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on tv too  i think we have practically reached saturation point sometimes i think less is more the club is funding its move to ashburton grove through a number of sources  including debt from banks  from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors  and from the sale of surplus property  including its highbury stadium it is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets  including asia  we have two executives travelling round japan and china at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs  and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too  as they are around the world  we have got a very good product  so it is very important we go and look at these markets  and make sure we are on the case
